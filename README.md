This repo consists of Data Exploration of Urban measures such as Energy, Population and Tree Cover in Melbourne City and how they contribute to the city's CO2 release.

Most of the exploration can be found as part of R code in folders pertaining to 'Qn' or questions I aimed to answer as part of this research. These questions were:

1) Considering the City of Melbourne's Energy Consumption, Population Distribution, and Tree 
Cover across the different areas of the city during the period 2011 - 2021: 
    a. What kind of trends, patterns, and relationships exist between these 3 characteristics of 
    the city? 
    b. How do they contribute to the C02 emission of the city during this period?
2) Based on your above visual analysis, what predictions can you make for the City of Melbourne 
using these three characteristics for 2024?

The title of this explorative research is: 
"Urban Sustainability Dynamics: Exploring the Interplay between Energy 
Consumption, Population Distribution, and Tree Cover in Melbourne 
(2011-2021) and their role in the cityâ€™s CO2 emission."
